Born and raised in Milano, I hold a BSc and MSc degree in Environmental Sciences from the University of Milano-Bicocca, where I completed my studies in 2018 with a thesis on chemometrics. \
Sometimes I think I could have chosen to study political economics, since I'm very interested in politics, as well as in the role that economic policies play in our daily life and overall wellbeing.

Still, I've always been fascinated by natural sciences, and growing up in a highly industrialised and densely populated area helped me to developed a kind of strong critical mindset about our society environmental externalities. 
I think I've kept this critical but curious mindset, which ultimately led me to pursue a PhD in Science and Management of Climate Change in Venice, starting from September 2020, after almost 2 years of experience in an engineering and consultancy company firm based in Milan.

In my free time, I like to spend time outdoor, hiking in the mountains and cooking. Home dinners with friends is also something I love. My current sport activities are focused on swimming, where I joined the Sant'Alvise Master team in Venice a few years ago.
