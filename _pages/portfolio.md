I am a strong supporter of open research, simply because I believe that is one of the key requirements to promote the development of an equal academic research. \
Although I am not a very experienced and skilled programmer, and my code is most likely very messy and not efficient, I'll try to post below some code I have used for some analysis or data processing framework.  

- **Tutorials on climate data analysis in Python**

These three tutorials have been used for a practical introductory lesson on climate data analysis for an undergraduate "Atmospheric and Climate Physics" course (A.Y. 2024/2025) and a M.Sc. "Geophysics and Cultural Heritage" course (A.Y. 2022/2023 and 2023/2024) at the University of Venice:
