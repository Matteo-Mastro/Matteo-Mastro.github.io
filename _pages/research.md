During my PhD, I have researched on three different topics related to the uncertainties surrounding the framework of the remaining carbon budget estimation. 
With this respect, I am particularly interested in the large-scale behavior of terrestrial ecosystems properties and their evolution under changing climatic conditions.\
Understanding some of the big unknowns in this scientific area will help to refine our ability to potentially predict terrestrial carbon outgassing, ecosystems state shifts and diebacks as a consequence of prolonged stress conditions.

## Publications
Below are the (very few!) publications or submitted contributions I have.

- **Mastropierro, M.**, Tanaka, K., Melnikova, I. et al. Testing GWP* to quantify non-CO2 contributions in the carbon budget framework in overshoot scenarios. npj Clim Atmos Sci 8, 101 (2025). [(https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-025-00980-7)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-025-00980-7)

This is the first paper coming from my PhD research, developed during my research visiting stay at LSCE in Paris under the guidance of Dr. Katsumasa Tanaka. \
It explores the implications for the remaining carbon budget of adopting a new developed metric (GWP-star) for converting $CH_{4}$ into $CO_{2}$ emissions in overshoot scenarios. \
