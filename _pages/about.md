I am an Environmental Scientist by training, passionate and curios about a broad set of environmental and climate topics.
Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Science and Management of Climate Change at Ca' Foscari University of Venice, under the supervision of Prof. Zanchettin, with a thesis titled "On terrestrial carbon cycle and land-atmosphere interactions modelling". \
My actual research interests are related to the (large-scale) biogeochemical and biophysical relationship between terrestrial ecosystems and climate, with the aid of Earth System Models or Simple Climate Models.

On another note, I am also a Short Term Consultant for The World Bank Group, investigating and modelling the sensitivity of health infrastructures physical accessibility to external shocks, such as floods and conflicts. The focus here is on vulnerable countries, with the goal of supporting the resilience of their infrastructure investments. 
With this respect, I am particularly interested in the opportunity given by open-source Earth-Observation and geospatial data, and analytics to provide valuable resources to support the decision making process.

- **Testing GWP-star to quantify non-CO2 contributions in the carbon budget framework: the case under overshoot scenarios**

The consideration of overshoot scenarios, in which a climate temperature target is temporarily exceeded, is gaining importance due to stable GHG emissions. However, it is still debated what are the climatic consequences of these scenarios, as well as how to consider non-CO_{2} emissions in this framework. Therefore, the aim of this study is to characterize the contribution of CH_{4}, a GHG with a short residence time in the atmosphere, by means of a newly developed metric of temperature equivalency conversion, denoted GWP* (Global Warming Potential-star). A simple climate model, coupled to an economic module, is used to assess different mitigation strategies, revealing inconsistencies in the temperature equivalency under long-term overshoot scenarios, therefore calling for attention in the deployment of GWP* in these contexts.

- **Drivers and uncertainty of Amazon carbon sink long-term and interannual variability in CMIP6 models**

The future of the Amazon ecosystem seems uncertain due to external pressures, such as climate change and land-use change, posing at risk the long-term stability of its carbon sink, with strong repercussions on the Earth system. In this study, the state-of-the-art generation of Earth System Models, CMIP6, is used to investigate the faith of Amazon carbon sink considering long-term factors and its sensitivity to interannual climatic variability. Despite strong divergences emerge from the multi-model ensemble, models agree in depicting CO_{2} fertilization as the prominent factor affecting the long-term Amazon carbon sink. ESMs also point to a major control of temperature at interannual time-scales, which mediate the impacts of ENSO and are expected to be exhacerbated by global warming.
